# The Story


In the story of “Subway Samurai,” players step into the shoes of a skilled kendo fighter who finds themself amidst the chaos of a zombie apocalypse in the streets of Glasgow. Armed with their trusty bamboo sword and unwavering determination, your player's only hope for survival lies in navigating the underground labyrinth of the Glasgow subway system. As they descend into the dark tunnels, they must contend with hordes of relentless zombies, their eerie moans echoing through the narrow passages.



The first leg of your player's harrowing journey takes them to Kelvinbridge, a once-thriving station now overrun by the undead. In this eerie subterranean battle, your player's kendo skills are put to the test as they fend off a relentless zombie warrior, forced to dance between life and death. The clashing of bamboo and rotting flesh serves as an overture for the even greater challenges that await. This foe drops a note, half written and ripped, which leads you to the next leg of your journey. The Barrowlands.



Your player's quest for survival brings them to The Barrowlands, another underground station turned into a nightmarish battleground. Here, among the flickering neon lights and haunting concert posters, they face a formidable zombie champion, who drops the other half of the note. This is where the story comes together.. At the heart of Glasgow's subway, your player must confront the ultimate adversary: the zombified Lord Provost, transformed into a grotesque and powerful creature. “The Brainz” of the outbreak. In a turn of events you discover the Provost dumped 10 Tonnes of “Zom-X” (a zombifying biochemical) into the River Clyde to ensure re-election after a bad term. The fate of Glasgow rests on your shoulders as you enter a showdown of epic proportions, where your kendo mastery and resilience will determine the outcome of the city's survival in this apocalyptic battle.
